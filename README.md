# Thaleo - Mini Game Engine
 
"Thaleo" game engine is an introduction for our customers of different ages and professions to the secrets of design and perhaps gaming. Our application helps enthusiasts learn about geometric shapes and how they can use them, to then create applications independently.

Thaleo is an educational platform specially designed to create 3D games. The platform offers a very user-friendly drag & drop interface, for beginners or experienced programmers. It can be used both by teachers who want to explain geometry to children in an interactive and fun way, but also by students who want to learn video game development either professionally or precisely in their free time. The application allows the creation of several scenes in which one can add 3D figures, lights of different sizes and angles and cameras from different perspectives.
